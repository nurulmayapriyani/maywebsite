The works I did in this Multi-Factor Authentication feature:

![](/uploads/mfa-login-modified-before.jpg){: width="1893" height="749"}

Login page before modification.

![](/uploads/mfa-login-modified-after.jpg){: width="1893" height="749"}

Login page after modification.
<br>Modified previous login page become clean but still has aesthetic value.

![](/uploads/mfa-activate.jpg){: width="1903" height="733"}

Activate Multi-Factor Authentication in My Profile menu will appear when user logged in with OTP 0 (MFA is nonactive). This button will change from OTP 0 to OTP 1 (MFA is nonactive but must activate) then showing a Multi-Factor Authentication Activation page.

![](/uploads/mfa-activation-profile.jpg){: width="1899" height="903"}

Scan the QR Code with Authenticator App and enter one-time code from the Authenticator App on the form. The one-time code in Authenticator App will be updated in every 30 seconds, that will be used for validation in the next login. This page will change from OTP 1 to OTP 2 (MFA is active) then redirect to home page.

After successfully activated MFA, in the next login, user with OTP 2 will see validation page right after login. User will need to enter the one-time code from the Authenticator App (that is exist after scanning QR Code in activation page, and be updated in every 30 seconds). If the code is valid, user will be redirected to home page.

Invalid code response of Multi-Factor Authentication Validation
<br>(invalid code will make error pop up show up, click "ok" to reinput the code)

![](/uploads/mfa-nonactivate.jpg){: width="1904" height="883"}

User with OTP 2 will see Nonactivate Multi-Factor Authentication in My Profile menu. This button will change from OTP 2 to OTP 1, logout automatically, and redirect to login page, so that user must activate MFA again in the next login.

![](/uploads/mfa-activation.jpg){: width="1899" height="893"}

Multi-Factor Authentication Activation page will appear when user logged in with OTP 1 or after click Nonactivate Multi-Factor Authentication in My Profile menu. This page will show up right after login page (that's why OTP 1 must activate). User will need to scan QR Code and entering one-time code from Authenticator App again.

![](/uploads/mfa-activation-error.jpg){: width="1899" height="893"}

Invalid code response of Multi-Factor Authentication Activation.
<br>(invalid code will make error alert show up and disable the button, to make the button enable again click close (x) on the error alert)
<br>This error alert is also applied in Multi-Factor Authentication Activation page in My Profile menu.

![](/uploads/mfa-activation-success.jpg){: width="1899" height="893"}

Valid code response of Multi-Factor Authentication Activation
<br>(valid code will make successful alert show up before redirect to home page)
<br>This successful alert is also applied in Multi-Factor Authentication Activation page in My Profile menu.
