Work Period of Project: 15th August 2023 - 2nd October 2023

The works I did in this Webhook feature:

![](/uploads/webhook-h2h-unchecked.jpg){: width="1893" height="749"}

Get Detail Identity from logged in user in core project.

![](/uploads/webhook-h2h-checked.jpg){: width="1893" height="749"}

Hide and show further form based on checkbox clicked.

![](/uploads/webhook-generate-clicked.jpg){: width="1903" height="733"}

![](/uploads/webhook-generate-done.jpg){: width="1903" height="733"}

Show loading effect on Generate button when the button is clicked and show another text (Refresh) on button once Application ID and API Key is generated. Generate text on button will only appear when user never click Generate button before. Once user have Application ID generated, the text on button will be changed to Refresh.

![](/uploads/webhook-refresh-clicked.jpg){: width="1903" height="733"}

![](/uploads/webhook-refresh-done.jpg){: width="1903" height="733"}

Refresh button only will regenerate API Key, Application ID only could be generated once.

![](/uploads/webhook-ipserver-outoflimit.jpg){: width="1899" height="903"}

![](/uploads/webhook-ipserver-limit.jpg){: width="1899" height="893"}

The maximal digit on each input is only 3 digits and the maximal limit number for IP Server input is 255, so when user type more than 255, the input will be changed to 255 once the input is not focused (user click somewhere else with the cursor).

![](/uploads/webhook-whatsapp-protocolscheme.jpg){: width="1899" height="893"}

If user type Webhook URL with protocol/scheme (https://), a validation error will show up below the input column, this is a protection to prevent double protocol/scheme in database.

![](/uploads/webhook-whatsapp-valid-number.jpg){: width="1899" height="893"}

WhatsApp No. input column won't allow user to type other than number, so when any character or alphabet is typed, there will be a validation error below the input column, it will be removed whenever user type any number again or delete any number.

![](/uploads/webhook-whatsapp-underminimal.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

![](/uploads/webhook-whatsapp-meetminimal.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When user type WhatsApp No. still less than minimal (10 digits), there will be a validation error below the column that will be removed when user have already typed WhatsApp No. which meet with the minimal limit. This is a bit protection to prevent user send invalid number.

![](/uploads/webhook-whatsapp-abovelimit.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When user type WhatsApp No. above of maximal limit (12 digits), it will not show whatever the user typed, so it will stop showing after the digits are already 12 length. This is also a bit protection to prevent user send inactive number.

![](/uploads/webhook-save-termcond-checked.jpg){: width="1904" height="883"}

When the checkbox of Term & Condition is clicked, the Save button will be enabled to click.

![](/uploads/webhook-save-clicked.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When the Save button is clicked, there will be pop up confirmation to protect any accidental click from user.

![](/uploads/webhook-save-confirmed.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When the Save button is confirmed, the Term & Condition checkbox and input columns will be disabled and the text on Save button will be changed to Update.

![](/uploads/webhook-update-enabled.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When user click Update button while the input is disabled, it will make the input is enabled again to be typed.

![](/uploads/webhook-update-termcond-checked.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

The Term & Condition will also make the Update button enabled just like when it enabled Save button before.

![](/uploads/webhook-update-clicked.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

And just like Save button, when the Update button is clicked (while the input is enabled), it will show pop up confirmation.

![](/uploads/webhook-update-confirmed.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When the Update is confirmed, it will also make Term & Condition checkbox and input columns disabled. And user could edit and update again by clicking Update button.

![](/uploads/webhook-ipserver-tooltip.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

![](/uploads/webhook-webhookurl-tooltip.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

There are also tooltips right after IP Server and Webhook URL columns that explain each titles.

![](/uploads/webhook-empty-save.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

![](/uploads/webhook-all-validation.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When user click save without filling the inputs, there would be validation erros of every input columns since all the input columns are required.
